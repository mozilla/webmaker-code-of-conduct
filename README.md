# DRAFT

This is where a centralized code of conduct will live for all Webmaker products and projects, as well as a suggested code of conduct for all Webmaker events.

## Rationale

The Webmaker Code of Conduct is an extension of the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation), which applies to all projects under Mozilla.

## Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md to your project

If you contribute to a repository on GitHub that is part of the Webmaker project, add [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to the root directory.

## Add your name to CHAMPIONS.md

To show your support for the Webmaker Code of Conduct, create a pull-request to add your name to [CHAMPIONS.md](CHAMPIONS.md). You should include your name and however you want to self-identify on the Internet (Github, Twitter, email)
